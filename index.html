                    is an Italian manufacturer of luxury <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"> sports
                        cars</a> and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV"> SUVs</a> based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is
                    owned by
                    the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.
                </p>
                <p>Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio
                    Lamborghini
                    S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine,
                    rear-wheel drive layout.
                    Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973
                    worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.
                    The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978.
                    American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian
                    investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994.
                    In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under
                    the control of the group's Audi division.
                </p>
                <p>New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and
                    saw an increased productivity for the brand.
                    In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis,
                    Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.</p>
                <p>Lamborghini currently produces the V10-powered Huracán, Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine
                    and will produce the Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid, as of 2024.
                    In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.

                    Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento,
                    Italy and continues to produce tractors.
                    Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the automobile manufacturer.

                <p>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
                    The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s.
                    Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.
                </p>
                <p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.
                    Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974.
                    The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980.
                    The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion.
                    Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987.
                    After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994.
                    In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.
                    New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini.
                    In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.
                    In 2021, the CEO of Lamborghini said that by 2024 all its models will be hybrid.
